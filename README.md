# Borderline Personality Disorder (BoPD) automatic disease screening tool

## BoPD overview
Borderline personality disorder (BoPD) is a psychological disorder that begins in early adulthood and is characterized by ≥5 of the following symptoms: frantic efforts to avoid real/imagined abandonment, a pattern of unstable/intense personal relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity that is potentially self-damaging, unstable mood, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate/intense anger, paranoid ideation/severe dissociation and recurrent suicidal or self-harming tendencies(American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Limandri, 2018). BoPD affects approximately 1–2% of the general population, and it is estimated that approximately 10% of psychiatric outpatients and 20% of psychiatric inpatients are affected by the disorder (Ellison, Rosenstein, Morgan, & Zimmerman, 2018; Lieb, Zanarini, Schmahl, Linehan, & Bohus, 2004).

BoPD is a complex disorder which has been associated with many comorbidities such as depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Zanarini et al., 1998a, 1998b). Due to this, patients with BoPD are often misdiagnosed and there is evidence that approximately 40% of patients have received a previous misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder compared with only 10% of patients without BoPD (Ruggero, Zimmerman, Chelminski, & Young, 2010). This highlights an unmet need for effective BoPD screening methods that enable an accurate and timely diagnosis.

## BoPD Automatic Screening Initiative

To address the unmet need for effective BoPD screening methods, an initiative has been formed to develop a machine learning algorithm that utilizes electronic health record (EHR) databases to automatically identify patients likely to have BoPD, but without formal diagnosis. Such an algorithm will facilitate efficient real-world clinical decision making for patients with BoPD.

The objective of the borderline personality disorder (BoPD) Automatic Screening Initiative is to advance timely identification of potential BoPD patients. This was made possible by the development of a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm screens electronic health record (EHR) data and automatically identifies patients with highly likely BoPD diagnosis for confirmation of clinical diagnosis.

In the pilot phase, the algorithm has been incorporated into a portable screening tool based on WinPython, a portable distribution of Python programming language for Windows.



## Develop environment
The portable WinPython can be implemented under windows operation system.

## Data used to develop the algorithm
We use de-identified Electronic Health Record (EHR) from Cerner Health Fact data. Data in Health Facts is directly extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMR) from hospitals who has data use agreement with Cerner. Encounters may include pharmacy, clinical and microbiology laboratory, admission, and billing information from affiliated patient care locations.
