# Borderline Personality Disorder (BoPD) automatic disease screening tool

## Introduction
The objective of the borderline personality disorder (BoPD) Automatic Screening Initiative is to advance timely identification of potential BoPD patients. This was made possible by the development of a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm screens electronic health record (EHR) data and automatically identifies patients with highly likely BoPD diagnosis for confirmation of clinical diagnosis.

In the pilot phase, the algorithm has been incorporated into a portable screening tool based on WinPython, a portable distribution of Python programming language for Windows.
## Develop environment
The portable WinPython can be implemented under windows operation system.

## Data used to develop the algorithm
We use de-identified Electronic Health Record (EHR) from Cerner Health Fact data. Data in Health Facts is directly extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMR) from hospitals who has data use agreement with Cerner. Encounters may include pharmacy, clinical and microbiology laboratory, admission, and billing information from affiliated patient care locations.
